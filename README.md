# SimpleDEX - Decentralized Exchange on Aptos

## ðŸ“‹ Description

SimpleDEX is a lightweight decentralized exchange (DEX) smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This project implements the core functionality of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) similar to Uniswap, enabling users to trade tokens and provide liquidity in a trustless, decentralized manner.

The smart contract features two primary functions:
- **Add Liquidity**: Allows users to become liquidity providers by depositing token pairs into the pool
- **Swap Tokens**: Enables seamless token swapping using the constant product formula (x * y = k)

The contract uses AptosCoin as the base trading pair for simplicity, making it easy to understand and deploy while maintaining the essential DEX mechanics that power modern decentralized finance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Our vision is to democratize access to decentralized finance on the Aptos ecosystem by providing a simple, efficient, and secure trading platform. SimpleDEX aims to:

- **Empower Users**: Give individuals complete control over their assets without intermediaries
- **Foster Innovation**: Serve as a foundation for more complex DeFi protocols and applications
- **Promote Accessibility**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for both novice and experienced DeFi users
- **Build Trust**: Leverage Aptos' security and Move's safety features to ensure reliable transactions
- **Support Growth**: Contribute to the expanding Aptos DeFi ecosystem

We believe in creating financial infrastructure that is transparent, permissionless, and accessible to everyone, regardless of geographic location or financial background.
